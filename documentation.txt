- Assumptions:
    - Assuming that blvd, apt, st, ave are always going to be the standard format for addresses
- Challenges:
    - Splitting lines in DataProcessor.java:
        - Line 30:
        - "George","Brown","345 3rd Blvd., Apt. 200","Seattle","WA","18"
        - I had an issue with splitting this one into 6 parts due to the address having a ','
        - I just want everything inside the "..."
        - Might be a cheap method, but if we remove the outer "\"", then we can separate each value by:
            - "\",\""
            - line = line.substring(1, line.length() - 1); remove outer quotes
            - String[] values = line.split("\",\""); split by ","
    - Some address formatting different in that there were extra whitespaces, or some had periods and commas, some didn't
        - Need to create a method that normalizes using basic regex
            - removes commas and periods inside of address value
            - removes extra whitespaces to a single whitespace
            - trim() for good measure
